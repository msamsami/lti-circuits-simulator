Help : 

After you created your circuit file using "iCircuitMaker", you should enter the name of generated file into the "SETTING INPUT" section of "project.m" Matlab file. Then click Run and the simulation will begin.

* If "iCircuitMaker" didn't run properly, open "vb6plugins" and click Install and then try to run the program.
